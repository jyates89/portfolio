### Welcome!

Like most people who are into technology, I like to learn new things... More times than I can count, I've looked
a topic up, taken some action, learned something new, and then never touch that particular bit of information in my
head again until the thing in question either breaks, needs to be updated, or needs improvements. I then need to do
more research to refresh the knowledge (I call this spin-up time.. maybe even turbo lag, for those interested in cars),
before I can actually start working on it again.

It's a pain to be stuck in that loop, and so this site is an effort on my part to both help me retain information better
by putting it into a walk-through format (basically restructuring it as I learn), and hopefully share it with others who
are interested.

It will also serve as a fun log of all the things I work on, so when I inevitably forget what I did, I can always
reference it here!

### Resources

I also want to track all of the useful resources I've found (whether it's books or simply useful websites), and so I'll
be steadily adding to the library section of this site. It will include both beginner and advanced resources, and I'm
hoping it be useful to both people who are trying figure out where to get started on a particular topic, and also those
who are just looking to learn more!

### Projects

I have a folder of personal projects (~60 repositories), accumulated throughout my years of software development, and
while not all of them are suitable for sharing, I'm going to try and clean them up and share them here. It's mostly
backend experimentation or scripting, with a couple of frontend experiments mixed in. Depending on the project type, I
might just list it and reference a README and a link to a repo, or I might actually host it so you can try it out!

Thanks for reading!
