# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets for your Next.js application. Files placed here will be served from the root path of your application.

## Usage

Place your static assets (images, fonts, etc.) in this directory. You can then reference them in your code like this:

```jsx
// Example usage in a component
<img src="/your-image.jpg" alt="Description" />
```

## Common Asset Types

- Profile pictures
- Logos
- Favicon
- Fonts
- Other static images and files

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive filenames
2. Optimize images before adding them
3. Consider using subdirectories for better organization (e.g., `/public/images/`, `/public/fonts/`)
